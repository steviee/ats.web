== Welcome to ATS.WEB

=== What is ATS.WEB
ATS.WEB stands for 'Applicant Tracking System' (.WEB) and is supposed to inherit its functionality from a windows desktop application called Effective Personal, wich was released in 2007 and written in C# and VB.NET.
AST.WEB will mimick the domain model and the use-cases one would expect from such an application. A complete list of features will follow as soon as I have compiled a list from the original software.

Best regards,
Stevie
